# userstyles
Userstyles made to varying levels of quality (Issues welcomed)

## What are userstyles?
Much like userscripts are extensions written to be installed in userscript managers for extended functionality, userstyles are stylesheets written to change the appearance of any particular website, either to fix some small issue or to completely rework the visual design of something, my preferred userstyle manager is [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), which is a fork of the largely-defunct Stylish.

## Versioning:
The versioning on the userscripts is defined by year.month.day-hotfix, for example 2024.12.25-1 would be a release for the 25th of December, 2024 with the first of any amount of possible additional hotfixes.

## Ones I've made:
### [yt-fullscreen-ish-theatre-mode.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishazfun/userstyles/main/yt-fullscreen-ish-theatre-mode.user.css)
Simple style that causes the YouTube player to fill the window when in Theatre Mode but not overlap the navigation bar.
### [phanpy-tweaks.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishazfun/userstyles/main/phanpy-tweaks.user.css)
A handful of adjustments to Phanpy.social, the third-party client for Mastodon.
