# userstyles
Userstyles made to varying levels of quality.

## What are userstyles?
Much like userscripts are extensions written to be installed in userscript managers for extended functionality, userstyles are stylesheets written to change the appearance of any particular website, either to fix some small issue or to completely rework the visual design of something, my preferred userstyle manager is [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), which is a fork of the largely-defunct Stylish.

## Ones I've made:
### [yt-fullscreen-ish-theatre-mode.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishazfun/userstyles/main/yt-fullscreen-ish-theatre-mode.user.css)
Simple style that causes the YouTube player to fill the window when in Theatre Mode but not overlap the navigation bar.
